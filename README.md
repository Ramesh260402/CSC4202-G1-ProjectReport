# CSC4202 Group 1 Project Report Repository

Welcome to the CSC4202 Group 1 Project Report repository! This repository contains the project report and related resources for our CSC4202 course project.

## Project Description

Our project focuses on course scheduling problem among university students. We aim to create a schedule that will meets credit constraints and prerequisites dependencies. Throughout the project, we have implemented various techniques, algorithms, and methodologies such as Implementing Topological Sorting using Python and Java to create a schedule that will meets credit constraints and prerequisites dependencies and implements dynamic programming for seat allocation problem (class capacity).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`/Topological Sorting Python`**: This directory contains all the source code and scripts used for the project using Python. It is the main implementation of the project. 

- **`/Topological Sorting Python`**: This directory contains all the source code and scripts used for the project using Java.

- **`/CSC4202_GroupProject_Report`**: This directory contains the project report in PDF format. The report provides a detailed analysis of our project, including [outline the key sections of the report, such as introduction, results, conclusion and more].

- **`/demonstration`**: This directory contains the demonstration video of the project (Python and Java).
